Amigo Documentation

#INTRODUCTION:
The Project 'Amigo' initially kicked off as an attempt to replicate what virtual assistants (like Siri,Bixby,Alexa, etc.) do. Amigo (curently under development) is a virtual assistant written in Python, that like most other virtual assistants aims to make your life easier.On startup, my *amigo* (pun intended) greets you according to time of the day, and tells on what version of python amigo runs upon, and boots into the program. For commands and its features, you can refer the keywords section below. Oh, and don't worry, as far as i know, i've made exceptions for each and every task. There are list of n features (updated on 21/12/2023) currently in Amigo. Since, this is an hobbyist attempt, if any errors found or suggestions (if any you'll be duely credited in this README file), feel free to contact me.
